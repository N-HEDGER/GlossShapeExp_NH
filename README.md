# GlossShapeExp_NH
Gloss experiment with stereo implemened.

Gloss/ stereo experiment.

Summary of main changes made:

1) Added GUI
2) Allowed for participants to quit at any time at the end of each trial.
3) Everything is now bundled into a big structure rather than spitting out loads of files
4) Added fixed trial order for debugging.
5) Spits out a log.txt file for each particpant, with trial info and timing of events.
6) Binocular session and monocular session implemented:

Binocular session = 486 trials (2 light fields x 9 gloss levels x 9 depth values x 3 stereo conditions) 
Monocular session = 162 trials (2 light fields x 9 gloss levels x 9 depth values x 1 stereo condition (mono)) 

Stimuli are 15 cm on the monitors in the SS lab.

The main file that drives the experiment is EXPMAIN.m. 

Still to do:

1) Monocular block still reads in old stimuli.
2) Agree on presentation times etc
3) Run through as dummy participant
4) Get someone with better stereo vision to check stimuli are ok.
